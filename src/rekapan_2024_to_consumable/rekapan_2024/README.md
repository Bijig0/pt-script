So mom sent me REKAPAN PPA PER PROYEK 2024, I want to send it over to my supabase dashboard
to make the rekapans but the format is different than how my system consumes it.

So this script is used to perform a group by on the rekapans to make them grouped
by date instead of by company

After running the first main.ts, standardize the dates manually
